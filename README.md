This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Whop Apps Template

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwhopio%2Fwhop-apps-template&env=WHOP_JWK_PK,API_KEY,NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID&envDescription=These%20API%20keys%20are%20needed%20for%20the%20SDK%20to%20work&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fdev.whop.com%2Fapps%2Fcreate-an-app%23environment-variables)

Click on `Use this template` to copy the template or run the following command

`yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/whopio/whop-apps-template`

This will create a Next.js application with the [**Whop Apps SDK**](https://dev.whop.com/apps/sdks) & [**Frosted UI**](https://dev.whop.com/apps/frosted) installed.

For the SDK to work, you will need to add the following environment variables to your project:

- **WHOP_JWK_PK**
- **API_KEY**
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID**
