This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Whop Apps Template

Click on `Use this template` to copy the template or run the following command

`yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/whopio/whop-apps-template`

This will create a Next.js application with the [**Whop Apps SDK**](https://dev.whop.com/apps/sdks) & [**Frosted UI**](https://dev.whop.com/apps/frosted) installed.

For the SDK to work, you will need to add the following environment variables to your project:

- **WHOP_API_KEY**
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID**
